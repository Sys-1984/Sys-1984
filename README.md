 Hi, Iâ€™m @Sys-1984
 I do not understand a single word on this website or what to do on it but I'm here anyway.
 About me: I like keyboards, I could not make a Geekhack account sadly.
 I have absolutly no idea how to code or how to work on this website, but that does not indicate that I will fall for scams\triangle schemes, if they exist. 
 I can feel the people reading this if there are any shakng their head at me
